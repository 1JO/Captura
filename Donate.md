Captura is made and maintained in personal time.
The application is Ad-Free.
The ads from the website will be removed once we reach our [Patreon goal]({{ site.links.patreon }}).
You can show your support by donating.

There are 3 ways to donate:

1. **Patreon (Recommended):** You can donate (recurring) to my Patreon account and help me achieve goals and get rewarded in return.
2. **Gratipay:** You can also donate (recurring) to the Gratipay team for Screna, the library powering Captura.
3. **Paypal:** You can also donate to my PayPal account. Preferrable for one-time donations.
